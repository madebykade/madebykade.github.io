            Our manifesto is an open declaration of how we operate. As with any practical policy, it is constantly changing to
            accomodate real world challenges. To see a full history and incremental improvements
            check out our <a href="https://github.com/madebykade/manifesto">manifesto repository.</a>
          </p>

          <p>
            The manifesto is not designed to be universally applicable. It is designed to help a group of like-minded people
            work together and gain practical insights to organisational theory.

            <h1>The Evaluation Framework</h1>
          </header>

          

<p>Generally a set of &ldquo;company values&rdquo; are useless. The only value we hold at Kade is <strong>improvement</strong>. Outside of that, individuals are welcome to improve in whatever they believe in. Below is a broad range of attributes that an individual can focus on which we believe contributes the most to themselves and the team.</p>

<p>Each atrribute represents one of many day-to-day practices that a team member with have, and they are grouped into three broad &ldquo;roles&rdquo; - Business Owner, Team Leader, and High Performer.</p>

<h5 id="business-owner">Business Owner</h5>

<ul>
<li>Diligent: Responsible, self motivating, and self disciplined</li>
<li>Egoless: seeks what is best for Kade even when it doesn&rsquo;t satisfy their own ego</li>
<li>Enjoyable: Contributes to culture</li>
<li>Curious: Seeks to understand all parts of the business</li>
<li>Humble: Cleans the dishes and picks up trash</li>
<li>Sensible: thinks sustainably; incrementally; long term; commercially</li>
<li>Inspiring: inspires others through work ethic and contribution</li>
<li>Honest: doesn&rsquo;t talk about people behind their backs</li>
<li>Candid: gives critical feedback well</li>
<li>Calm: if you always look busy it&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;re out of control. Don&rsquo;t be busy, be focused</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="team-leader">Team Leader</h5>

<ul>
<li>Adaptive: Owns and adapts processes to become more effective to increase output</li>
<li>Grows the team: Shares workload with team - sets context and offloads tasks when appropriate</li>
<li>Shares the load: picks up work from others when workload is imbalanced</li>
