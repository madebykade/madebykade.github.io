      <description> Internal transparency Everyone who is part of the Kade Collective practices Radical Condor. This means that we are 100% transparent internally. Everything to do with strategy and personal performance is discussed openly.
Public facing transparency The following is public
 Salaries Profit Revenues Traffic General Practices  What are the exceptions?  Company valuations (this is because it may scare off investors. If their appetitie is public, then it could harm them when trying to close deals in the future) If a project does not directly belong to us, we will only expose information that already publicly available We will not expose any practices which give us a competitive advantage  </description>

      <description>Profits are paid monthly to Partners in the Kade Collective. This frequency gives the Collective a mindset to incrementally improve the parts of the business that makes it more successful. This policy creates a challenge in that we need track each project individually for continuous improvement.
All projects are tracked via Google Analytics and Compass. Each project is siloed to cover the key aspects of the project&amp;rsquo;s health:
 Revenue Expenses Traffic Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) Lifetime Value (LTV)  Additional ways of separating  AWS tags: https://aws.</description>

      <description>Generally a set of &amp;ldquo;company values&amp;rdquo; are useless. The only value we hold at Kade is improvement. Outside of that, individuals are welcome to improve in whatever they believe in. Below is a broad range of attributes that an individual can focus on which we believe contributes the most to themselves and the team.
Each atrribute represents one of many day-to-day practices that a team member with have, and they are grouped into three broad &amp;ldquo;roles&amp;rdquo; - Business Owner, Team Leader, and High Performer.</description>

      <description>The Kade Collective manifesto See more at http://madebykade.com/manifesto
Our manifesto is an open declaration of how we intend to operate. It is as mutuable as any policy that is confronted with the real world.
The manifesto is not designed to be universally applicable. It is designed to see how a group of like minded people work together while learning a few things about organisational theory along the way. It is strongly shaped by our past experience and iteratively improved upon as we continue to work together.</description>
